PRIM'S ALGORITHM:
1)This algorithm begins to construct the shortest spanning tree from any vertex in the graph.
2)To obtain the minimum distance, it traverses one node more than one time.
3)The time complexity of Prim’s algorithm is O(V2).

KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM:
1)This algorithm begins to construct the shortest spanning tree from the vertex having the lowest weight in the graph.
2)It crosses one node only one time.
3)The time complexity of Kruskal’s algorithm is O(E log V).
